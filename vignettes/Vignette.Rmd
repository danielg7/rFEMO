rFEMO Introduction
========

## About the package

`rFEMO` seeks to aid the production of fire effects monitoring reports through the use of standard tools and techniques. The aim is to create easy, streamlined, reproduceable reports and assist in data management.

FEMO and FOBS reports vary considerably within and between units and rarely have consistent data storage solutions. Data portability, storage, and consistency aid later analyses and comparisons within and between plots. `rFEMO` is a step towards providing standardized process to make clear, easily comparable graphs and effectively manage data.

## Get rFEMO

```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library("devtools")

install_github("danielg7/rFEMO", build=FALSE, dependencies=c("DEPENDS", "IMPORTS"))
```

## Workflow

`rFEMO` can be used in a number of different ways, but we recommend the following workflow. In brief, we will create a folder for our data, populate it with our data, and edit the report to quickly generate a long-term, standardized data organization and reporting solution.

Reports are written in Markdown, which is a quickly learned formatting markup for documents. Learn more [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

### Get started

If you haven't yet installed it, make sure you install R and R Studio:

* [R](http://cran.r-project.org) is a stastical programming and graphing environment.
* After R is installed, install [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), a development environment that makes using R much easier.

R Studio opens with four main windows: a console (bottom left), a tabbed scripting / writing enivornment (upper left), a working environment (upper right) and a file / plot viewer (bottom right).

The console, shown as `> ` is where you will directly enter commands. 

### Create a blank workspace

1. Check your working directory by typing `getwd()` in the command line.
This working directory is will be where you will be creating your report folder. You can easily change it by going to `Files` tab on the right and navigating to the folder where you will want to create your data folder. 

2. Create a blank workspace using the `createReportFolder` command:

+ Type in the command line (`> `): `createReportFolder(ProjectName = "YourProjectName", ProjectDate = "YYYYMMDD")`

+ This creates a folder structure within your working directory named "`YYYYMMDD_YourProjectName`"
Within that, it will create folders to store your data. It will create a 'dummy' FEMO report called "`YYYYMMDD_YourProjectName_FemoReport.Rmd`" and a dummy weather observation sheet (`YYYYMMDD_YourProjectName_FirelineWeatherObservations.csv`)in `Data/Weather/`

### Explore the workspace

Make sure the `Files` tab is opened on your right. Open the folder corresponding to your project. You'll see:  
```
Data   
-- FirelineObservations  
--- YYYYMMDD_YourProjectName_FireBehaviorObservations.csv  # Not yet implemented.
-- GPS  
--- YYYYMMDD_YourProjectName_GPSPoints.csv   # Not yet implemented.
-- Photos  
--- ExamplePhoto.jpg
-- WeatherObservations  
--- YYYYMMDD_YourProjectName_FirelineWeatherObservations.csv
-- Maps  
--- ExampleMap.png  
```

This tool helps you establish naming conventions for storing your data, which is the easiest, clearest form of metadata for your FEMO / FOBS data.

### Add your observations

### Edit the Fireline Weather Observations

In your spreadsheet application of choice (usually Microsoft Excel), open `YYYYMMDD_YourProjectName_FirelineWeatherObservations.csv` and take a look. 

Fill in your data here. It's important to include data such as FEMO names, fire names, and locations. Make sure to save it as a ".csv" again. CSV files are raw text that can be read by any program and allows your data to remain portable through the years. 

### Tweak plots

Once you have saved the fireline weather observations above, you can begin to tweak the plots you can see below.

You can also change the captions by filling in `fig.cap="Your figure caption"` within the R figure chunk (*e.g.*, `{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap = "Your figure caption"}`)

#### tempPlot
```{r, echo = FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
weatherObservations <- read.csv(file = system.file("extdata", "YYMMDD_FireName_FirelineWeatherObservations.csv", package = "rFEMO"), skip = 1)

weatherObservations$DateTime <- paste(weatherObservations$Date_ddmmyyyy," ",weatherObservations$Time_hhmm)

weatherObservations$DateTime <- dmy_hm(weatherObservations$DateTime)
```

```{r echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,fig.cap="Plot of temperature change produced from tempPlot."}
tempPlot(Temp = weatherObservations$Temperature_F,
         DateTime = weatherObservations$DateTime, 
         Temp_HighBoundary = 75) 
```

`tempPlot` takes the `Temperature_F` values and `DateTime` values from `weatherObservations` and produces a standardized plot. You can note high and low prescription boundaries using `Temp_HighBoundary` and `Temp_LowBoundary`. If left blank, no prescription lines are added.

#### rhPlot

```{r, echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,fig.cap="Plot of RH change produced from rhPlot."}
rhPlot(RH = weatherObservations$RH,
       DateTime = weatherObservations$DateTime,
       RH_LowBoundary = 25,
       RH_HighBoundary = 75)
```

`rhPlot` takes the `RH` values and `DateTime` values from `weatherObservations` and produces a standardized plot. You can note high and low prescription boundaries using `RH_LowBoundary` and `RH_HighBoundary`. If left blank, no prescription lines are added.

#### windPlot

```{r WindObservations, echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,fig.cap="Plot of wind vectors produced from windPlot."}
weatherObservations$windDegree <- as.numeric(as.character(
  windConvert(cardinalWind = weatherObservations$Direction,
  LightAndVariable = "L/V")))

weatherObservations$Windspeed_mph[weatherObservations$Windspeed_mph == "L/V"] <- NA
weatherObservations$Windspeed_mph <- as.numeric(weatherObservations$Windspeed_mph)

windPlot(DateTime = weatherObservations$DateTime,
         windDegrees = weatherObservations$windDegree,
         windSpeed = weatherObservations$Windspeed_mph,
         Wind_LowBoundary = 3,
         Wind_HighBoundary = 10)
```

`windPlot` takes the `windDegrees`, `windSpeed`, and `DateTime` values from `weatherObservations` and produces a standardized wind vector plot. You can note high and low prescription boundaries using `Wind_LowBoundary` and `Wind_HighBoundary`. If left blank, no prescription lines are added.

windDegrees has to be in degree format. If you recorded wind direction in cardinal directions as is common, the `windConvert` function can convert it into cardinal directions. 

### Tables

Tables in Markdown are relatively easy. Note the example provided. `|` and `---` are used to create cells and text is put within them. You can easily edit this to make new descriptions of objectives.

### Figures and Maps

Including figures and maps is also easy.

For a local file:
`![alt text](Photos/img.png)`  

For an image on the web:  
`![alt text](http://example.com/logo.png)`

**Warning**: Sometimes errors will appear when images included are too large. Try to keep them smaller than 1 mg.

### Knit report

To create reports, click the drop down that says "Knit" at the top of your editing window. Choose either "Knit Word" or "Knit PDF". You may want to edit the Word Document later to change the Heading styles.

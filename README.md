# rFEMO
Development of a framework for automatic generation of fire effects monitoring (FEMO) reports.

Presently, this package can generate a standard set of folders, make a report, and make it easier for you to create wind and RH plots.

Future developments:
* Make it easy to scrape from a standardized Google Form -> Google Sheet to allow quick data entry
* Create functions to automatically create RH and Temperature plots
* Create options to automatically add prescription boundary parameters for graphs (i.e., RH < 25, WS > 20 mph, etc.)
* Make inclusion of photos easier.
* Write custom .css to make an easier to consume report.

# rFEMO

This package seeks to aid the production of fire effects monitoring reports through the use of standard tools and techniques. The aim is to create easy, streamlined, reproduceable reports and assist in data management.

Current features:
* Easy wind vector charts pulled from standard cardinal directions
* Generate standard folder structures and create report framework in R.

Future developments:
* A vignette documenting a workflow and the resulting report.
* Make it easy to scrape from a standardized Google Form -> Google Sheet to allow quick data entry
* Create functions to automatically create RH and Temperature plots
* Create options to automatically add prescription boundary parameters for graphs (i.e., RH < 25, WS > 20 mph, etc.)
* Make inclusion of photos easier.
* Write custom .css to make an easier to consume report.
